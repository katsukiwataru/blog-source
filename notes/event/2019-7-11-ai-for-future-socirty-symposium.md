~100 new papers every day in 2018

### errors

2011 |> AI 26% vs human 5%
2016 |> AI 3%

## restore/ improve urban infra

### auto-driving

`waymo`

### robtics

2015 |> 65%
2016 |> 78%
2018 |> 96%

learn pouring

### Detetion of diabetic retinopathy

expertise at low cost

### Black box?

go beyond doctors `age`,`gender`...etc`

# language

## 2017 Transformer Model

BERT

## tools for scientific discovery

tensorflow and cows
[blog.google]()

## autoML

current: solution = ML expertise + data + computation

solution = data + computation ?

Neural Architecture Search

1. gen models
2. train few hours
3. use loss of gened models as reinforcement learning signal

~2012

increase computering power |> double CPUs? |> TGPU

Reduced-orecision Numerics => full adders`FA`

g.co/cloudgpu

edge TPUs => low power equipments

## What's wrong?

know too little on start especially on new problems

### vision

- bigger models but sparsely activated
- single modlel to slove more tasks
- dynmatic learn and grow pathways to lager ones

Pre-Example Routing && MoE layers

## use of AI in society

## summary

1.AutoML is getting faster and more accurate than human AI experts.

2.Google's TPUs are so specialize in solving machine learning problems and runs at a insane speed.

- ResNet-50 Training in 2 minutes
- processing images at 1.05M/second

  3.Using AI to build tools for scientific researchs will unlock new possibilities.

  4.The starting point of computing a new model is still too low. Maybe we could put already trained models into a cloud and let all new models routing through them. Kind of training them to choose the dependencies by themselves.

  5.I like the last question by attendees, he asked if we are focusing too much on AI and lacking the theoretical understanding.(especially with AutoML)
